        <h3>Who is the course instructor</h3>
        <p>Trevor</p>

        <h3>Who is your class tutor</h3>
        <p>Sama Ahmad</p>

        <h3>Have you any programming or web design experience?</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout the past year, as part of my Bachelor of Information Technology studies, I have acquired valuable experience in both programming and web design domains.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have successfully completed the Introduction to Programming and Programming units, where I gained proficiency in Python and Java programming languages. Additionally, through the User-Centred Design unit, I developed skills in web design, focusing on creating user-friendly and visually appealing websites.

        <h3>Do you see yourself as a programmer, designer, or both?</h3>
        <p>From a career development perspective, my primary interest lies in pursuing roles within the user experience (UX) domain.  
        </p>
        <p>As I envision my professional path, I see myself leaning more towards becoming a Web Designer rather than a programmer.
        </p>
        <p>This choice stems from my strong passion for crafting exceptional user experiences, focusing on the visual design, usability, and overall satisfaction of website visitors.</p>

        <h3>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</h3>
        <p>This course forms part of the Bachelor of Information Technology. In studying this unit and the degree I am hoping to further understand the different elements of the development lifecycle.
        </p>
        <P>Through completing the course work, it will provide me with a hands-on learning experience that can help me development my career as a Project Manager.</P>

        <h3>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</h3>
        <p>In studying the Web Programming unit, I am hoping to development by technical skills associated with the programming languages like HTML, CSS and Javascript.
        </p>
        <p>Through gaining practical experience in these web programming languages, it will provide with practical experience in better understanding how to develop websites and mobile applications.</p>

        <h3>What websites do you use the most?</h3>
        <p>smh.com.au, theage.com.au, domain.com.au, fool.com.au, youtube.com</p>
